\addchap*{Abstract}

This work presents the development of an graphical user interface for programming ROS based robots. ROS (Robot Operating System) is a robotics middleware and is considered as the de-facto standard framework for robot software development. The second fundamental framework used for development is Blockly - an open-source JavaScript library made by Google, which provides a visual code editor and a code generation interface for web applications. Programming then is done by simply connecting blocks. Using these frameworks means that the tool can be easily deployed and run on many different platforms. \toolname{} - the name of the tool and a portmanteau of ROS and Blockly - provides three key components: an interface to manage code blocks, an interface to create demos, and an interface to manage demos. Therefore the presented tool tackles two key points of the field of robotics: teaching robot programming methods and abstracting the complex implementation to a level, where very little technical expertise is required.
